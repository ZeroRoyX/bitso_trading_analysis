# bitso_trading_analysis

Since Bitso's dataset is not properly calculated in certain columns, I decided to modify them with proper formulas according to the column in order do a better analysis of your trades.
It is quite simple, but I hope you find it useful.

I hope also Bitso can improve its dataset with this code in the future. Bitso, if you find it useful, just give me a shoutout.

Cheers,

ZeroRoy
